- 👋 Hi, I’m @harmoneers-tenor. I am new to community forums. I use MuseScore to learn my tenor part in a vocal choral group.
- 👀 I’m interested in restoring the sound on my computer.
- 🌱 I’m currently on a season break and will be learning new music soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking for guidance in resolving a problem (see below).
- 📫 How to reach me ... Through this forum, I guess?

I'm old school: MS 1.2/Windows 7. Tried updating to MS 3.0, then 3.03 - FAIL, lost all sound.
